# BioPhysics Computation Server System (BPCSS)

**BPCSS** is a reproducible and modular pipeline designed for academic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using all-atom models. It supports protein structure preparation, loop modeling, minimization, equilibration, and production-level simulations.

This workflow integrates:
- **GROMACS** – for high-performance MD simulation
- **CHARMM-GUI** – for system setup and membrane insertion
- **PDB-Tools Web** – for structure cleanup
- **DaReUS-Loop** – for loop modeling and structure repair
- **Python 3 + Scientific Packages** – for automation, batch processing, and analysis

> Originally developed for GPCRs such as **5-HT₂A receptor (PDB: 6A94)**, BPCSS is easily extensible to related membrane proteins, ligand-bound receptors, and protein complexes.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔬 Structural refinement and loop modeling
- ⚛️ Equilibration and validation of protein-ligand systems
- 🧬 End-to-end automation with reproducible configuration
