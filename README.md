# BPCSS
BioPhysics Computation Server System (BPCSS) is an academic molecular dynamics pipeline built using GROMACS, CHARMM-GUI, and Python for generating equilibrated and validated protein models. Originally developed for GPCRs like 5-HT2AR, it supports large-scale simulations to study ligand binding and signal transduction
